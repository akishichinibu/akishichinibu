# Hello! I'm akishichinibu ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a full-stack engineer living in Tokyo, Japan. I have a deep passion for coding and enjoy both front-end and back-end development.

Currently, Iâ€™m focused on backend development, primarily using **AWS** and **Go**. I also play a key role in designing code and system architecture, ensuring that my projects are efficient and maintainable.

In my personal time, I love coding in **Rust** and **TypeScript**. I enjoy exploring new technologies and building projects that push my skills further.

Feel free to check out my repositories, and Iâ€™m always open to collaboration and discussions!

Looking forward to connecting with you!
